# number_game
A number guessing game that allows the user to guess a number within a given range.
The player decides the range of numbers that will be used in the game.
If a user decided the range should start from 10 and stop at 145, then the game will have a range from 10 to 145 (inclusive)
The player will have a number of turns to make guesses for the number. If they fail to guess correctly, it will subtract their number of guesses
Once a player has taken all their turns, a result on their success will be printed.
